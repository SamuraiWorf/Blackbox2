15 Balls
-> 8Ball

5 Cues, for different strengths
not facing, instead direction via playerpos <-> cueballpos

-> now we have speed and initial direction for the cueballpos

Consider each ball as a circle of radius 0.25

Then simulate on timestep with 1 tick delay

if radii added sq larger than distance sq -> Collision

keep a list of moving balls (maybe just the cue ball)
check collision of each moving ball agains each other ball (unique pairs only)
-> each ball has info on which balls were collided with

for each ball now calculate new velocity

add velocity to position per ball

next tick
